## Classification with Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgBoost)

Implementation of the xgBoost technique on roadside maintenance data set to identify major factor contributing to the risk of collision for roadside maintenance workers. The data contains more than 2 million work orders from the state of California and describe work zone features, road features, traffic flow and volume and collision charactersitics. The project is sponsored by [California Department of Transportation](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/research-innovation-system-information) through [Advanced Highway Maintenance & Construction Technology](http://ahmct.ucdavis.edu/) research center.
